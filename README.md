# Predictive-Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-Commodity-Market-Dynamics

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook along with a fully containerized pipeline developed as part of my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis Project for the International School of Economics (ISET), Class of 2025.

The `notebook.ipynb` in this repository includes all the relevant data processing, modeling, and explanatory commentary that supports the main findings of the thesis. This README serves as a technical guide and quickstart manual for setting up and running the pipeline. For a comprehensive analysis, detailed methodology, and in-depth discussion, please refer to the full written thesis available here.
